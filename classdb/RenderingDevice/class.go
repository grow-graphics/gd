/*
[RenderingDevice] is an abstraction for working with modern low-level graphics APIs such as Vulkan. Compared to [RenderingServer] (which works with Godot's own rendering subsystems), [RenderingDevice] is much lower-level and allows working more directly with the underlying graphics APIs. [RenderingDevice] is used in Godot to provide support for several modern low-level graphics APIs while reducing the amount of code duplication required. [RenderingDevice] can also be used in your own projects to perform things that are not exposed by [RenderingServer] or high-level nodes, such as using compute shaders.
On startup, Godot creates a global [RenderingDevice] which can be retrieved using [method RenderingServer.get_rendering_device]. This global [RenderingDevice] performs drawing to the screen.
[b]Local RenderingDevices:[/b] Using [method RenderingServer.create_local_rendering_device], you can create "secondary" rendering devices to perform drawing and GPU compute operations on separate threads.
[b]Note:[/b] [RenderingDevice] assumes intermediate knowledge of modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan, Direct3D 12, Metal or WebGPU. These graphics APIs are lower-level than OpenGL or Direct3D 11, requiring you to perform what was previously done by the graphics driver itself. If you have difficulty understanding the concepts used in this class, follow the [url=https://vulkan-tutorial.com/]Vulkan Tutorial[/url] or [url=https://vkguide.dev/]Vulkan Guide[/url]. It's recommended to have existing modern OpenGL or Direct3D 11 knowledge before attempting to learn a low-level graphics API.
[b]Note:[/b] [RenderingDevice] is not available when running in headless mode or when using the Compatibility rendering method.

The [param draw_flags] indicates if the texture attachments of the framebuffer should be cleared or ignored. Only one of the two flags can be used for each individual attachment. Ignoring an attachment means that any contents that existed before the draw list will be completely discarded, reducing the memory bandwidth used by the render pass but producing garbage results if the pixels aren't replaced. The default behavior allows the engine to figure out the right operation to use if the texture is discardable, which can result in increased performance. See [RDTextureFormat] or [method texture_set_discardable].
The [param breadcrumb] parameter can be an arbitrary 32-bit integer that is useful to diagnose GPU crashes.

rd.draw_list_end()
[/codeblock]
The [param draw_flags] indicates if the texture attachments of the framebuffer should be cleared or ignored. Only one of the two flags can be used for each individual attachment. Ignoring an attachment means that any contents that existed before the draw list will be completely discarded, reducing the memory bandwidth used by the render pass but producing garbage results if the pixels aren't replaced. The default behavior allows the engine to figure out the right operation to use if the texture is discardable, which can result in increased performance. See [RDTextureFormat] or [method texture_set_discardable].
The [param breadcrumb] parameter can be an arbitrary 32-bit integer that is useful to diagnose GPU crashes. If Godot is built in dev or debug mode; when the GPU crashes Godot will dump all shaders that were being executed at the time of the crash and the breadcrumb is useful to diagnose what passes did those shaders belong to.
It does not affect rendering behavior and can be set to 0. It is recommended to use [enum BreadcrumbMarker] enumerations for consistency but it's not required. It is also possible to use bitwise operations to add extra data. e.g.

Returns the name of the type of object for the given [param type_index]. This value must be in range [code][0; get_tracked_object_type_count - 1][/code]. If [method get_tracked_object_type_count] is 0, then type argument is ignored and always returns the same string.
The return value is important because it gives meaning to the types passed to [method get_driver_memory_by_object_type], [method get_driver_allocs_by_object_type], [method get_device_memory_by_object_type], and [method get_device_allocs_by_object_type]. Examples of strings it can return (not exhaustive):
- DEVICE_MEMORY
- PIPELINE_CACHE
- SWAPCHAIN_KHR
- COMMAND_POOL
Thus if e.g. [code]get_tracked_object_name(5)[/code] returns "COMMAND_POOL", then [code]get_device_memory_by_object_type(5)[/code] returns the bytes used by the GPU for command pools.
