# Go + Godot 4.3 [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/grow.graphics/gd.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/grow.graphics/gd)

This module provides a safe performant way to work with Godot 4.3, in Go via the GDExtension interface.

You can support the project and prioritise issues [here](https://buy.stripe.com/4gw14maETbnX3vOcMM)

```go
// This file is all you need to start a project in Go + Godot.
// Save it somewhere, install the `gd` command and use `gd run` to get started.
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"grow.graphics/gd"
	"grow.graphics/gd/gdextension"
)

type HelloWorld struct {
	gd.Class[HelloWorld, gd.SceneTree]
}

// Initialize implements the Godot MainLoop _initialize interface (virtual function).
func (h *HelloWorld) Initialize() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World from Go!")
}

func main() {
	godot, ok := gdextension.Link()
	if !ok {
		return
	}
	gd.Register[HelloWorld](godot)
}

```

## Getting Started
The module includes a drop-in replacement for the go command called `gd` that 
makes it easy to work with projects that run within Godot. It enables you to
start developing a new project from a single main.go file, to install it, make
sure that your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` and run:

```sh
	go install grow.graphics/gd/cmd/gd@master
```

Now when you can run `gd run`, `gd test` on the main package in your project's 
directory, things will work as expected. The tool will create a "graphics" 
subdirectory where you can manage your assets via the Godot Editor.

Running the command without any arguments will startup the editor. 

**NOTE** On linux (and macos if you have brew), `gd` will download Godot for you automatically!  
**HINT**  On Windows, you'll want to 
[setup CGO](https://github.com/go101/go101/wiki/CGO-Environment-Setup).

If you don't want to use the `gd` command, you can build a shared library with
the `go` command directly:

```sh
go build -o example.so -buildmode=c-shared
```

## Design Principles

Godot classes are exported by the `gd` package and can be referred to by 
their standard Godot names, for example `gd.Object` is an 
[Object](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_object.html) 
reference. There's no inheritance, so to access the 'super' class, you need 
to call `Super()` on your custom 'Class'. All Godot classes have methods
to cast to the classes they extend for example `AsObject()` or `AsNode2D()`.

Methods have been renamed to follow Go conventions, so instead of
underscores, methods are named as PascalCase. Keep this in mind when
referring to the Godot documentation.

https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/index.html

## Semi-Automatic Memory Management

Godot types are preferred over Go types, in order to keep allocations optional. 
All values are tied to a [gd.Lifetime] value, each extension class has two lifetimes:

    (a) `Temporary` any values associated with it will be freed when Go returns to Godot.
    (b) `KeepAlive` values will be associated with the class and will be freed when the 
	     class is destroyed by Godot.

This module aims to offer memory safety for race-free extensions, if you discover
a way to unintentionally do something unsafe (like double free, use-after-free or
a segfault), using methods on types exported by the root `gd` package please open 
an issue. 

## Recommendations

Start with a main.go file, model your project in Go using structs to represent the 
world, space or state of your project. Go is an excellent language for textual 
representation. Use the `gd` command to launch the Godot editor when you want to 
create visual representation of your structures. The Godot editor is an excellent 
tool for importing media, managing assets and designing the visual and spatial aspects 
of a project. Don't forget to write tests!

## Where Do I Find?

```
* Godot Class            -> gd.{ClassName}
* Godot Class Method     -> gd.{ClassName}.{pascal(MethodName)}
* Godot Utility Function -> gd.Lifetime.{pascal(UtilityName)} OR gd.{pascal(UtilityName)} (pure)
* Godot Enum             -> gd.{EnumName}
* Godot Enum Value       -> gd.{EnumName}{EnumValueName}
* Godot Singleton        -> gd.{ClassName}(gd.Lifetime) // function returns the singleton, they cannot be stored.
```

## Low Level Rendering API

This module exposes an idiomatic implementation of the Godot RenderingDevice API, a low-level driver-agnostic
rendering API.

```
gd.RenderingDevice(gd.Lifetime) // Full access to the low level RenderingDevice API (see grow.graphics/rd)
```

## Performance
It's feasible to write high performance code using this module, keep to Godot types where possible and avoid escaping memory to the heap in frequently called functions. 

### Zero Allocations
Benchmarking shows method calls from Go -> Godot do not allocate in practice. 

Allocations are currently unavoidable for GDScript -> Go calls (but not 
for class virtual method overrides such as `Ready` or `Process`, which 
should be allocation free).

We've got some ideas to reduce allocations for GDScript -> Go calls, when
arguments fit entirely within registers. TBA.

## Examples
There are a number of examples in the [examples](https://github.com/grow-graphics/eg) 
repo. All examples are designed to be run with `gd run` without any additional setup.

## Testing
To run the go tests for this module `cd internal && gd test`.

## Supported Platforms

* Windows
* Linux   (including Steam Deck)
* Mac     (including Apple Silicon)
* Android (including MetaQuest)
* IOS     (should work, untested)

## Known Limitations

* No support for indexed properties
* No support for Godot class functions with varargs.
* No support for script extensions.
* 64bit support only.
* No Web Export Yet (we have ideas on how to solve this)
* No planned support for proprietary consoles.
