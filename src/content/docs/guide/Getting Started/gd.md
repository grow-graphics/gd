The `gd` command can be installed using `go install`, this command is a drop in replacement for the `go` command for working with graphics.gd projects.

```sh
go install graphics.gd/cmd/gd@release
```

#### Quick Rundown

```sh
gd       # launch the Godot editor to manage assets and design the UI.
gd run   # run the project in debug mode.
gd build # export the project as a release depending upon GOOS and GOARCH.
gd test  # run your Go tests.
```

#### Why a new command?

The `gd` command takes care of all the build flags and configuration files needed to setup Go + Godot so that things will "just work" in the same way that the `go` command does.

If you are already well versed in Godot and GDExtension, or you want to use your own build tools, you can use the `go` command to build the shared library yourself:

```sh
CC="zig cc" go build -o example.so -buildmode=c-shared
```

#### What does the `gd` command do?

Everything you would have to setup for yourself if you were using `go` directly:

* downloads and runs Godot for you on supported platforms.
* creates a `graphics` directory to house the godot project.
* creates a blank `project.godot` and `main.tscn`.
* creates the `.gdextension` library and enables it.
* outputs Go binaries into the `graphics` directory.
* sets up a `.gitignore` to ignore these compiled Go libraries.
* creates export presets that export into `releases`.
* sets the correct `zig` flags when cross-compiling.
* uses `vpk` to bundle the project into a self-updating release.
* sets up Go tests to run correctly within the Godot runtime.
