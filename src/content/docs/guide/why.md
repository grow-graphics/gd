Whilst there are some other Open Source projects in the Go graphics space (check out [Ebiten](https://ebitengine.org/) for 2D and [G3N](http://g3n.rocks/) for 3D), these projects do not share the same level of contribution, functionality and support that Godot does.

Godot has an excellent visual editor, a large community and a wide range of features and functionality but there's a difficult choice to make when it comes to deciding upon which language to use, the official options are:

* **GDScript** for quick Python-like iterative scripting with loose typing.
* **C#** which is well known in the game development space, but it's large and not native.
* **C++** which is native but you lose memory safety + it's a behemoth of a language.

**Go** may be the more balanced choice here, it's native, fully typed with a simple syntax, memory safe with fast compile times. It also has a great standard library and community ecosystem.
