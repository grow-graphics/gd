/*
A* (A star) is a computer algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices (points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation uses points in 3D space and Euclidean distances by default.
You must add points manually with [method add_point] and create segments manually with [method connect_points]. Once done, you can test if there is a path between two points with the [method are_points_connected] function, get a path containing indices by [method get_id_path], or one containing actual coordinates with [method get_point_path].
It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a class that extends [AStar3D] and override methods [method _compute_cost] and [method _estimate_cost]. Both take two indices and return a length, as is shown in the following example.
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
class MyAStar:

	extends AStar3D

	func _compute_cost(u, v):
	    return abs(u - v)

	func _estimate_cost(u, v):
	    return min(0, abs(u - v) - 1)

[/gdscript]
[csharp]
public partial class MyAStar : AStar3D

	{
	    public override float _ComputeCost(long fromId, long toId)
	    {
	        return Mathf.Abs((int)(fromId - toId));
	    }

	    public override float _EstimateCost(long fromId, long toId)
	    {
	        return Mathf.Min(0, Mathf.Abs((int)(fromId - toId)) - 1);
	    }
	}

[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
[method _estimate_cost] should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e. [code]_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)[/code]. This serves as a hint to the algorithm because the custom [method _compute_cost] might be computation-heavy. If this is not the case, make [method _estimate_cost] return the same value as [method _compute_cost] to provide the algorithm with the most accurate information.
If the default [method _estimate_cost] and [method _compute_cost] methods are used, or if the supplied [method _estimate_cost] method returns a lower bound of the cost, then the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost paths. Here, the cost of a path equals the sum of the [method _compute_cost] results of all segments in the path multiplied by the [code]weight_scale[/code]s of the endpoints of the respective segments. If the default methods are used and the [code]weight_scale[/code]s of all points are set to [code]1.0[/code], then this equals the sum of Euclidean distances of all segments in the path.

	// AStar3D methods that can be overridden by a [Class] that extends it.

[AStarGrid2D] is a variant of [AStar2D] that is specialized for partial 2D grids. It is simpler to use because it doesn't require you to manually create points and connect them together. This class also supports multiple types of heuristics, modes for diagonal movement, and a jumping mode to speed up calculations.

An animation player is used for general-purpose playback of animations. It contains a dictionary of [AnimationLibrary] resources and custom blend times between animation transitions.
Some methods and properties use a single key to reference an animation directly.

If the library's key is an empty string (known as the default library), the forward slash is omitted, being the same key used by the library.
[AnimationPlayer] is better-suited than [Tween] for more complex animations, for example ones with non-trivial timings. It can also be used over [Tween] if the animation track editor is more convenient than doing it in code.

This helper class can be used to store [Variant] values on the filesystem using INI-style formatting. The stored values are identified by a section and a key:
[codeblock]
[section]
some_key=42
string_example="Hello World3D!"
a_vector=Vector3(1, 0, 2)
[/codeblock]
The stored data can be saved to or parsed from a file, though ConfigFile objects can also be used directly without accessing the filesystem.
The following example shows how to create a simple [ConfigFile] and save it on disc:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
# Create new ConfigFile object.
var config = ConfigFile.new()

# Store some values.
config.set_value("Player1", "player_name", "Steve")
config.set_value("Player1", "best_score", 10)
config.set_value("Player2", "player_name", "V3geta")
config.set_value("Player2", "best_score", 9001)

# Save it to a file (overwrite if already exists).
config.save("user://scores.cfg")
[/gdscript]
[csharp]
// Create new ConfigFile object.
var config = new ConfigFile();

// Store some values.
config.SetValue("Player1", "player_name", "Steve");
config.SetValue("Player1", "best_score", 10);
config.SetValue("Player2", "player_name", "V3geta");
config.SetValue("Player2", "best_score", 9001);

// Save it to a file (overwrite if already exists).
config.Save("user://scores.cfg");
[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
This example shows how the above file could be loaded:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var score_data = {}
var config = ConfigFile.new()

# Load data from a file.
var err = config.load("user://scores.cfg")

# If the file didn't load, ignore it.
if err != OK:

	return

# Iterate over all sections.
for player in config.get_sections():

	# Fetch the data for each section.
	var player_name = config.get_value(player, "player_name")
	var player_score = config.get_value(player, "best_score")
	score_data[player_name] = player_score

[/gdscript]
[csharp]
var score_data = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary();
var config = new ConfigFile();

// Load data from a file.
Error err = config.Load("user://scores.cfg");

// If the file didn't load, ignore it.
if (err != Error.Ok)

	{
	    return;
	}

// Iterate over all sections.
foreach (String player in config.GetSections())

	{
	    // Fetch the data for each section.
	    var player_name = (String)config.GetValue(player, "player_name");
	    var player_score = (int)config.GetValue(player, "best_score");
	    score_data[player_name] = player_score;
	}

[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
Any operation that mutates the ConfigFile such as [method set_value], [method clear], or [method erase_section], only changes what is loaded in memory. If you want to write the change to a file, you have to save the changes with [method save], [method save_encrypted], or [method save_encrypted_pass].
Keep in mind that section and property names can't contain spaces. Anything after a space will be ignored on save and on load.
ConfigFiles can also contain manually written comment lines starting with a semicolon ([code];[/code]). Those lines will be ignored when parsing the file. Note that comments will be lost when saving the ConfigFile. This can still be useful for dedicated server configuration files, which are typically never overwritten without explicit user action.
[b]Note:[/b] The file extension given to a ConfigFile does not have any impact on its formatting or behavior. By convention, the [code].cfg[/code] extension is used here, but any other extension such as [code].ini[/code] is also valid. Since neither [code].cfg[/code] nor [code].ini[/code] are standardized, Godot's ConfigFile formatting may differ from files written by other programs.

Base class for all UI-related nodes. [Control] features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change.
For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from [Control] and [Container] nodes.
[b]User Interface nodes and input[/b]
Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each [Viewport] is responsible for propagating [InputEvent]s to their child nodes. As the [member SceneTree.root] is a [Window], this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game.
Input events are propagated through the [SceneTree] from the root node to all child nodes by calling [method Node._input]. For UI elements specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method [method _gui_input], which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, [member mouse_filter], focus, or if the event was inside of the control's bounding box.
Call [method accept_event] so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an input, it becomes handled so [method Node._unhandled_input] will not process it.
Only one [Control] node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive events. To get the focus, call [method grab_focus]. [Control] nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus.
Sets [member mouse_filter] to [constant MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE] to tell a [Control] node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button.
[Theme] resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the [Theme] on a [Control] node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the [code]add_theme_*_override[/code] methods, like [method add_theme_font_override]. You can override the theme with the Inspector.
[b]Note:[/b] Theme items are [i]not[/i] [Object] properties. This means you can't access their values using [method Object.get] and [method Object.set]. Instead, use the [code]get_theme_*[/code] and [code]add_theme_*_override[/code] methods provided by this class.

A 2D convex polygon shape, intended for use in physics. Used internally in [CollisionPolygon2D] when it's in [constant CollisionPolygon2D.BUILD_SOLIDS] mode.

[Decal]s are used to project a texture onto a [Mesh] in the scene. Use Decals to add detail to a scene without affecting the underlying [Mesh]. They are often used to add weathering to building, add dirt or mud to the ground, or add variety to props. Decals can be moved at any time, making them suitable for things like blob shadows or laser sight dots.
They are made of an [AABB] and a group of [Texture2D]s specifying [Color], normal, ORM (ambient occlusion, roughness, metallic), and emission. Decals are projected within their [AABB] so altering the orientation of the Decal affects the direction in which they are projected. By default, Decals are projected down (i.e. from positive Y to negative Y).
The [Texture2D]s associated with the Decal are automatically stored in a texture atlas which is used for drawing the decals so all decals can be drawn at once. Godot uses clustered decals, meaning they are stored in cluster data and drawn when the mesh is drawn, they are not drawn as a post-processing effect after.
[b]Note:[/b] Decals cannot affect an underlying material's transparency, regardless of its transparency mode (alpha blend, alpha scissor, alpha hash, opaque pre-pass). This means translucent or transparent areas of a material will remain translucent or transparent even if an opaque decal is applied on them.
[b]Note:[/b] Decals are only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility. When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 decals can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 decals on a single mesh resource will result in decals flickering in and out as the camera moves.
[b]Note:[/b] When using the Mobile rendering method, decals will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the decal's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, [member GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin] must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the decal may not be visible on the mesh.

[EditorImportPlugin]s provide a way to extend the editor's resource import functionality. Use them to import resources from custom files or to provide alternatives to the editor's existing importers.
EditorImportPlugins work by associating with specific file extensions and a resource type. See [method _get_recognized_extensions] and [method _get_resource_type]. They may optionally specify some import presets that affect the import process. EditorImportPlugins are responsible for creating the resources and saving them in the [code].godot/imported[/code] directory (see [member ProjectSettings.application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory]).

This is the control that implements property editing in the editor's Settings dialogs, the Inspector dock, etc. To get the [EditorInspector] used in the editor's Inspector dock, use [method EditorInterface.get_inspector].
[EditorInspector] will show properties in the same order as the array returned by [method Object.get_property_list].
If a property's name is path-like (i.e. if it contains forward slashes), [EditorInspector] will create nested sections for "directories" along the path. For example, if a property is named [code]highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color[/code], it will be shown as "Node Path Color" inside the "GDScript" section nested inside the "Highlighting" section.
If a property has [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_GROUP] usage, it will group subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new group starts. An empty group name effectively ends the current group. [EditorInspector] will create a top-level section for each group. For example, if a property with group usage is named [code]Collide With[/code] and its hint string is [code]collide_with_[/code], a subsequent [code]collide_with_area[/code] property will be shown as "Area" inside the "Collide With" section. There is also a special case: when the hint string contains the name of a property, that property is grouped too. This is mainly to help grouping properties like [code]font[/code], [code]font_color[/code] and [code]font_size[/code] (using the hint string [code]font_[/code]).
If a property has [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_SUBGROUP] usage, a subgroup will be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be created for each subgroup.
[b]Note:[/b] Unlike sections created from path-like property names, [EditorInspector] won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.

Add the extracted strings to argument [code]msgids[/code] or [code]msgids_context_plural[/code] if context or plural is used.
When adding to [code]msgids_context_plural[/code], you must add the data using the format [code]["A", "B", "C"][/code], where [code]A[/code] represents the extracted string, [code]B[/code] represents the context, and [code]C[/code] represents the plural version of the extracted string.

[EditorUndoRedoManager] is a manager for [UndoRedo] objects associated with edited scenes. Each scene has its own undo history and [EditorUndoRedoManager] ensures that each action performed in the editor gets associated with a proper scene. For actions not related to scenes ([ProjectSettings] edits, external resources, etc.), a separate global history is used.
The usage is mostly the same as [UndoRedo]. You create and commit actions and the manager automatically decides under-the-hood what scenes it belongs to. The scene is deduced based on the first operation in an action, using the object from the operation. The rules are as follows:
- If the object is a [Node], use the currently edited scene;
- If the object is a built-in resource, use the scene from its path;
- If the object is external resource or anything else, use global history.
This guessing can sometimes yield false results, so you can provide a custom context object when creating an action.
[EditorUndoRedoManager] is intended to be used by Godot editor plugins. You can obtain it using [method EditorPlugin.get_undo_redo]. For non-editor uses or plugins that don't need to integrate with the editor's undo history, use [UndoRedo] instead.
The manager's API is mostly the same as in [UndoRedo], so you can refer to its documentation for more examples. The main difference is that [EditorUndoRedoManager] uses object + method name for actions, instead of [Callable].

In C# the reference must be disposed manually, which can be done with the [code]using[/code] statement or by calling the [code]Dispose[/code] method directly.
[b]Note:[/b] To access project resources once exported, it is recommended to use [ResourceLoader] instead of [FileAccess], as some files are converted to engine-specific formats and their original source files might not be present in the exported PCK package.
[b]Note:[/b] Files are automatically closed only if the process exits "normally" (such as by clicking the window manager's close button or pressing [b]Alt + F4[/b]). If you stop the project execution by pressing [b]F8[/b] while the project is running, the file won't be closed as the game process will be killed.

[GraphEdit] provides tools for creation, manipulation, and display of various graphs. Its main purpose in the engine is to power the visual programming systems, such as visual shaders, but it is also available for use in user projects.
[GraphEdit] by itself is only an empty container, representing an infinite grid where [GraphNode]s can be placed. Each [GraphNode] represents a node in the graph, a single unit of data in the connected scheme. [GraphEdit], in turn, helps to control various interactions with nodes and between nodes. When the user attempts to connect, disconnect, or delete a [GraphNode], a signal is emitted in the [GraphEdit], but no action is taken by default. It is the responsibility of the programmer utilizing this control to implement the necessary logic to determine how each request should be handled.
[b]Performance:[/b] It is greatly advised to enable low-processor usage mode (see [member OS.low_processor_usage_mode]) when using GraphEdits.

[GraphNode] allows to create nodes for a [GraphEdit] graph with customizable content based on its child controls. [GraphNode] is derived from [Container] and it is responsible for placing its children on screen. This works similar to [VBoxContainer]. Children, in turn, provide [GraphNode] with so-called slots, each of which can have a connection port on either side.
Each [GraphNode] slot is defined by its index and can provide the node with up to two ports: one on the left, and one on the right. By convention the left port is also referred to as the [b]input port[/b] and the right port is referred to as the [b]output port[/b]. Each port can be enabled and configured individually, using different type and color. The type is an arbitrary value that you can define using your own considerations. The parent [GraphEdit] will receive this information on each connect and disconnect request.
Slots can be configured in the Inspector dock once you add at least one child [Control]. The properties are grouped by each slot's index in the "Slot" section.
[b]Note:[/b] While GraphNode is set up using slots and slot indices, connections are made between the ports which are enabled. Because of that [GraphEdit] uses the port's index and not the slot's index. You can use [method get_input_port_slot] and [method get_output_port_slot] to get the slot index from the port index.

Hyper-text transfer protocol client (sometimes called "User Agent"). Used to make HTTP requests to download web content, upload files and other data or to communicate with various services, among other use cases.
See the [HTTPRequest] node for a higher-level alternative.
[b]Note:[/b] This client only needs to connect to a host once (see [method connect_to_host]) to send multiple requests. Because of this, methods that take URLs usually take just the part after the host instead of the full URL, as the client is already connected to a host. See [method request] for a full example and to get started.
A [HTTPClient] should be reused between multiple requests or to connect to different hosts instead of creating one client per request. Supports Transport Layer Security (TLS), including server certificate verification. HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate success, 3xx redirection (i.e. "try again, but over here"), 4xx something was wrong with the request, and 5xx something went wrong on the server's side.
For more information on HTTP, see [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP]MDN's documentation on HTTP[/url] (or read [url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616]RFC 2616[/url] to get it straight from the source).
[b]Note:[/b] When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the [code]INTERNET[/code] permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.
[b]Note:[/b] It's recommended to use transport encryption (TLS) and to avoid sending sensitive information (such as login credentials) in HTTP GET URL parameters. Consider using HTTP POST requests or HTTP headers for such information instead.
[b]Note:[/b] When performing HTTP requests from a project exported to Web, keep in mind the remote server may not allow requests from foreign origins due to [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS]CORS[/url]. If you host the server in question, you should modify its backend to allow requests from foreign origins by adding the [code]Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *[/code] HTTP header.
[b]Note:[/b] TLS support is currently limited to TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. Attempting to connect to a TLS 1.3-only server will return an error.
[b]Warning:[/b] TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not supported. Revoked certificates are accepted as long as they are otherwise valid. If this is a concern, you may want to use automatically managed certificates with a short validity period.

If you'd still like to load an image file just like any other [Resource], import it as an [Image] resource instead, and then load it normally using the [method @GDScript.load] method.
[b]Note:[/b] The image can be retrieved from an imported texture using the [method Texture2D.get_image] method, which returns a copy of the image:
[codeblock]
var texture = load("res://icon.svg")
var image: Image = texture.get_image()
[/codeblock]
An [ImageTexture] is not meant to be operated from within the editor interface directly, and is mostly useful for rendering images on screen dynamically via code. If you need to generate images procedurally from within the editor, consider saving and importing images as custom texture resources implementing a new [EditorImportPlugin].
[b]Note:[/b] The maximum texture size is 16384×16384 pixels due to graphics hardware limitations.

The [JSON] enables all data types to be converted to and from a JSON string. This useful for serializing data to save to a file or send over the network.

# ...

[b]Note:[/b] Both parse methods do not fully comply with the JSON specification:
- Trailing commas in arrays or objects are ignored, instead of causing a parser error.
- New line and tab characters are accepted in string literals, and are treated like their corresponding escape sequences [code]\n[/code] and [code]\t[/code].
- Numbers are parsed using [method String.to_float] which is generally more lax than the JSON specification.

Godot can record videos with non-real-time simulation. Like the [code]--fixed-fps[/code] [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html]command line argument[/url], this forces the reported [code]delta[/code] in [method Node._process] functions to be identical across frames, regardless of how long it actually took to render the frame. This can be used to record high-quality videos with perfect frame pacing regardless of your hardware's capabilities.
Godot has 2 built-in [MovieWriter]s:
- AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio ([code].avi[/code] file extension). Lossy compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing [member ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/mjpeg_quality]. The resulting file can be viewed in most video players, but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with [VideoStreamPlayer]. MJPEG does not support transparency. AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in size at most.
- PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio ([code].png[/code] file extension). Lossless compression, large file sizes, slow encoding. Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as [url=https://ffmpeg.org/]FFmpeg[/url] after recording. Transparency is currently not supported, even if the root viewport is set to be transparent.
If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third-party software, you can extend the [MovieWriter] class to create your own movie writers. This should typically be done using GDExtension for performance reasons.
[b]Editor usage:[/b] A default movie file path can be specified in [member ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/movie_file]. Alternatively, for running single scenes, a [code]movie_file[/code] metadata can be added to the root node, specifying the path to a movie file that will be used when recording that scene. Once a path is set, click the video reel icon in the top-right corner of the editor to enable Movie Maker mode, then run any scene as usual. The engine will start recording as soon as the splash screen is finished, and it will only stop recording when the engine quits. Click the video reel icon again to disable Movie Maker mode. Note that toggling Movie Maker mode does not affect project instances that are already running.
[b]Note:[/b] MovieWriter is available for use in both the editor and exported projects, but it is [i]not[/i] designed for use by end users to record videos while playing. Players wishing to record gameplay videos should install tools such as [url=https://obsproject.com/]OBS Studio[/url] or [url=https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/]SimpleScreenRecorder[/url] instead.

MultiMesh provides low-level mesh instancing. Drawing thousands of [MeshInstance3D] nodes can be slow, since each object is submitted to the GPU then drawn individually.
MultiMesh is much faster as it can draw thousands of instances with a single draw call, resulting in less API overhead.
As a drawback, if the instances are too far away from each other, performance may be reduced as every single instance will always render (they are spatially indexed as one, for the whole object).
Since instances may have any behavior, the AABB used for visibility must be provided by the user.
[b]Note:[/b] A MultiMesh is a single object, therefore the same maximum lights per object restriction applies. This means, that once the maximum lights are consumed by one or more instances, the rest of the MultiMesh instances will [b]not[/b] receive any lighting.

/*
Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct children of a node) should have unique names.
A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk and then instantiated into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.
[b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the scene tree, it receives the [constant NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE] notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i.e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered before its child's.
Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the [constant NOTIFICATION_READY] notification and their respective [method _ready] callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the parent nodes.
This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method _enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally [method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).
[b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the "process" state, so that they receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] (in seconds) is passed as an argument. Physics processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled with [method set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics engine.
Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the [method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.
To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instantiating scenes into other scenes), an "owner" can be set for the node with the [member owner] property. This keeps track of who instantiated what. This is mostly useful when writing editors and tools, though.
Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method queue_free], it will also free all its children.
[b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy to manage, you could create groups like "enemies" or "collectables" for example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the methods on [SceneTree].
[b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, see [ENetMultiplayerPeer]), it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling [method rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its [NodePath] (make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos.
[b]Note:[/b] The [code]script[/code] property is part of the [Object] class, not [Node]. It isn't exposed like most properties but does have a setter and getter (see [method Object.set_script] and [method Object.get_script]).

/*
Occlusion culling can improve rendering performance in closed/semi-open areas by hiding geometry that is occluded by other objects.
The occlusion culling system is mostly static. [OccluderInstance3D]s can be moved or hidden at run-time, but doing so will trigger a background recomputation that can take several frames. It is recommended to only move [OccluderInstance3D]s sporadically (e.g. for procedural generation purposes), rather than doing so every frame.
The occlusion culling system works by rendering the occluders on the CPU in parallel using [url=https://www.embree.org/]Embree[/url], drawing the result to a low-resolution buffer then using this to cull 3D nodes individually. In the 3D editor, you can preview the occlusion culling buffer by choosing [b]Perspective > Debug Advanced... > Occlusion Culling Buffer[/b] in the top-left corner of the 3D viewport. The occlusion culling buffer quality can be adjusted in the Project Settings.
[b]Baking:[/b] Select an [OccluderInstance3D] node, then use the [b]Bake Occluders[/b] button at the top of the 3D editor. Only opaque materials will be taken into account; transparent materials (alpha-blended or alpha-tested) will be ignored by the occluder generation.
[b]Note:[/b] Occlusion culling is only effective if [member ProjectSettings.rendering/occlusion_culling/use_occlusion_culling] is [code]true[/code]. Enabling occlusion culling has a cost on the CPU.

An Omnidirectional light is a type of [Light3D] that emits light in all directions. The light is attenuated by distance and this attenuation can be configured by changing its energy, radius, and attenuation parameters.
[b]Note:[/b] When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 omni lights on a single mesh resource will result in omni lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be increased by adjusting [member ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object].
[b]Note:[/b] When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, omni lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, [member GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin] must be increased on the mesh.

This resource defines an OpenXR action. Actions can be used both for inputs (buttons/joystick/trigger/etc) and outputs (haptics).
OpenXR performs automatic conversion between action type and input type whenever possible. An analog trigger bound to a boolean action will thus return [code]false[/code] if the trigger is depressed and [code]true[/code] if pressed fully.
Actions are not directly bound to specific devices, instead OpenXR recognizes a limited number of top level paths that identify devices by usage. We can restrict which devices an action can be bound to by these top level paths. For instance an action that should only be used for hand held controllers can have the top level paths "/user/hand/left" and "/user/hand/right" associated with them. See the [url=https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#semantic-path-reserved]reserved path section in the OpenXR specification[/url] for more info on the top level paths.
Note that the name of the resource is used to register the action with.

OpenXR uses an action system similar to Godots Input map system to bind inputs and outputs on various types of XR controllers to named actions. OpenXR specifies more detail on these inputs and outputs than Godot supports.
Another important distinction is that OpenXR offers no control over these bindings. The bindings we register are suggestions, it is up to the XR runtime to offer users the ability to change these bindings. This allows the XR runtime to fill in the gaps if new hardware becomes available.
The action map therefore needs to be loaded at startup and can't be changed afterwards. This resource is a container for the entire action map.

Action sets in OpenXR define a collection of actions that can be activated in unison. This allows games to easily change between different states that require different inputs or need to reinterpret inputs. For instance we could have an action set that is active when a menu is open, an action set that is active when the player is freely walking around and an action set that is active when the player is controlling a vehicle.
Action sets can contain the same action with the same name, if such action sets are active at the same time the action set with the highest priority defines which binding is active.

[b]Incremental search:[/b] Like [ItemList] and [Tree], [PopupMenu] supports searching within the list while the control is focused. Press a key that matches the first letter of an item's name to select the first item starting with the given letter. After that point, there are two ways to perform incremental search: 1) Press the same key again before the timeout duration to select the next item starting with the same letter. 2) Press letter keys that match the rest of the word before the timeout duration to match to select the item in question directly. Both of these actions will be reset to the beginning of the list if the timeout duration has passed since the last keystroke was registered. You can adjust the timeout duration by changing [member ProjectSettings.gui/timers/incremental_search_max_interval_msec].

[ProceduralSkyMaterial] provides a way to create an effective background quickly by defining procedural parameters for the sun, the sky and the ground. The sky and ground are defined by a main color, a color at the horizon, and an easing curve to interpolate between them. Suns are described by a position in the sky, a color, and a max angle from the sun at which the easing curve ends. The max angle therefore defines the size of the sun in the sky.
[ProceduralSkyMaterial] supports up to 4 suns, using the color, and energy, direction, and angular distance of the first four [DirectionalLight3D] nodes in the scene. This means that the suns are defined individually by the properties of their corresponding [DirectionalLight3D]s and globally by [member sun_angle_max] and [member sun_curve].

A regular expression (or regex) is a compact language that can be used to recognize strings that follow a specific pattern, such as URLs, email addresses, complete sentences, etc. For example, a regex of [code]ab[0-9][/code] would find any string that is [code]ab[/code] followed by any number from [code]0[/code] to [code]9[/code]. For a more in-depth look, you can easily find various tutorials and detailed explanations on the Internet.
To begin, the RegEx object needs to be compiled with the search pattern using [method compile] before it can be used.
[codeblock]
var regex = RegEx.new()
regex.compile("\\w-(\\d+)")
[/codeblock]
The search pattern must be escaped first for GDScript before it is escaped for the expression. For example, [code]compile("\\d+")[/code] would be read by RegEx as [code]\d+[/code]. Similarly, [code]compile("\"(?:\\\\.|[^\"])*\"")[/code] would be read as [code]"(?:\\.|[^"])*"[/code]. In GDScript, you can also use raw string literals (r-strings). For example, [code]compile(r'"(?:\\.|[^"])*"')[/code] would be read the same.
Using [method search], you can find the pattern within the given text. If a pattern is found, [RegExMatch] is returned and you can retrieve details of the results using methods such as [method RegExMatch.get_string] and [method RegExMatch.get_start].
[codeblock]
var regex = RegEx.new()
regex.compile("\\w-(\\d+)")
var result = regex.search("abc n-0123")
if result:

	print(result.get_string()) # Would print n-0123

[/codeblock]
The results of capturing groups [code]()[/code] can be retrieved by passing the group number to the various methods in [RegExMatch]. Group 0 is the default and will always refer to the entire pattern. In the above example, calling [code]result.get_string(1)[/code] would give you [code]0123[/code].
This version of RegEx also supports named capturing groups, and the names can be used to retrieve the results. If two or more groups have the same name, the name would only refer to the first one with a match.
[codeblock]
var regex = RegEx.new()
regex.compile("d(?<digit>[0-9]+)|x(?<digit>[0-9a-f]+)")
var result = regex.search("the number is x2f")
if result:

	print(result.get_string("digit")) # Would print 2f

[/codeblock]
If you need to process multiple results, [method search_all] generates a list of all non-overlapping results. This can be combined with a [code]for[/code] loop for convenience.
[codeblock]
for result in regex.search_all("d01, d03, d0c, x3f and x42"):

	print(result.get_string("digit"))

# Would print 01 03 0 3f 42
[/codeblock]
[b]Example of splitting a string using a RegEx:[/b]
[codeblock]
var regex = RegEx.new()
regex.compile("\\S+") # Negated whitespace character class.
var results = []
for result in regex.search_all("One  Two \n\tThree"):

	results.push_back(result.get_string())

# The `results` array now contains "One", "Two", "Three".

SkeletonIK3D is used to rotate all bones of a [Skeleton3D] bone chain a way that places the end bone at a desired 3D position.

This [SkeletonModification2D] uses an algorithm called Cyclic Coordinate Descent Inverse Kinematics, or CCDIK, to manipulate a chain of bones in a [Skeleton2D] so it reaches a defined target.
CCDIK works by rotating a set of bones, typically called a "bone chain", on a single axis. Each bone is rotated to face the target from the tip (by default), which over a chain of bones allow it to rotate properly to reach the target. Because the bones only rotate on a single axis, CCDIK [i]can[/i] look more robotic than other IK solvers.

/*
This [SkeletonModification2D] uses an algorithm called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics, or FABRIK, to rotate a bone chain so that it reaches a target.
FABRIK works by knowing the positions and lengths of a series of bones, typically called a "bone chain". It first starts by running a forward pass, which places the final bone at the target's position. Then all other bones are moved towards the tip bone, so they stay at the defined bone length away. Then a backwards pass is performed, where the root/first bone in the FABRIK chain is placed back at the origin. Then all other bones are moved so they stay at the defined bone length away. This positions the bone chain so that it reaches the target when possible, but all of the bones stay the correct length away from each other.
Because of how FABRIK works, it often gives more natural results than those seen in [SkeletonModification2DCCDIK]. FABRIK also supports angle constraints, which are fully taken into account when solving.
[b]Note:[/b] The FABRIK modifier has [code]fabrik_joints[/code], which are the data objects that hold the data for each joint in the FABRIK chain. This is different from [Bone2D] nodes! FABRIK joints hold the data needed for each [Bone2D] in the bone chain used by FABRIK.

A TileSet can be configured so that its tiles expose more or fewer properties. To do so, the TileSet resources use property layers, which you can add or remove depending on your needs.
For example, adding a physics layer allows giving collision shapes to your tiles. Each layer has dedicated properties (physics layer and mask), so you may add several TileSet physics layers for each type of collision you need.

Tweens are mostly useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be interpolated over a range of values. The name [i]tween[/i] comes from [i]in-betweening[/i], an animation technique where you specify [i]keyframes[/i] and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them. Animating something with a [Tween] is called tweening.
[Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween]; it would be difficult to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node. Tweens are also more light-weight than [AnimationPlayer], so they are very much suited for simple animations or general tasks that don't require visual tweaking provided by the editor. They can be used in a "fire-and-forget" manner for some logic that normally would be done by code. You can e.g. make something shoot periodically by using a looped [CallbackTweener] with a delay.
A [Tween] can be created by using either [method SceneTree.create_tween] or [method Node.create_tween]. [Tween]s created manually (i.e. by using [code]Tween.new()[/code]) are invalid and can't be used for tweening values.
A tween animation is created by adding [Tweener]s to the [Tween] object, using [method tween_property], [method tween_interval], [method tween_callback] or [method tween_method]:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var tween = get_tree().create_tween()
tween.tween_property($Sprite, "modulate", Color.RED, 1)
tween.tween_property($Sprite, "scale", Vector2(), 1)
tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)
[/gdscript]
[csharp]
Tween tween = GetTree().CreateTween();
tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "modulate", Colors.Red, 1.0f);
tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "scale", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);
tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode("Sprite").QueueFree));
[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
This sequence will make the [code]$Sprite[/code] node turn red, then shrink, before finally calling [method Node.queue_free] to free the sprite. [Tweener]s are executed one after another by default. This behavior can be changed using [method parallel] and [method set_parallel].
When a [Tweener] is created with one of the [code]tween_*[/code] methods, a chained method call can be used to tweak the properties of this [Tweener]. For example, if you want to set a different transition type in the above example, you can use [method set_trans]:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var tween = get_tree().create_tween()
tween.tween_property($Sprite, "modulate", Color.RED, 1).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_SINE)
tween.tween_property($Sprite, "scale", Vector2(), 1).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_BOUNCE)
tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)
[/gdscript]
[csharp]
Tween tween = GetTree().CreateTween();
tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "modulate", Colors.Red, 1.0f).SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Sine);
tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "scale", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f).SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Bounce);
tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode("Sprite").QueueFree));
[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
Most of the [Tween] methods can be chained this way too. In the following example the [Tween] is bound to the running script's node and a default transition is set for its [Tweener]s:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var tween = get_tree().create_tween().bind_node(self).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_ELASTIC)
tween.tween_property($Sprite, "modulate", Color.RED, 1)
tween.tween_property($Sprite, "scale", Vector2(), 1)
tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)
[/gdscript]
[csharp]
var tween = GetTree().CreateTween().BindNode(this).SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Elastic);
tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "modulate", Colors.Red, 1.0f);
tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "scale", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);
tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode("Sprite").QueueFree));
[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
Another interesting use for [Tween]s is animating arbitrary sets of objects:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var tween = create_tween()
for sprite in get_children():

	tween.tween_property(sprite, "position", Vector2(0, 0), 1)

[/gdscript]
[csharp]
Tween tween = CreateTween();
foreach (Node sprite in GetChildren())

	tween.TweenProperty(sprite, "position", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);

[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
In the example above, all children of a node are moved one after another to position (0, 0).
You should avoid using more than one [Tween] per object's property. If two or more tweens animate one property at the same time, the last one created will take priority and assign the final value. If you want to interrupt and restart an animation, consider assigning the [Tween] to a variable:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var tween
func animate():

	if tween:
	    tween.kill() # Abort the previous animation.
	tween = create_tween()

[/gdscript]
[csharp]
private Tween _tween;

public void Animate()

	{
	    if (_tween != null)
	        _tween.Kill(); // Abort the previous animation
	    _tween = CreateTween();
	}

[/csharp]
[/codeblocks]
Some [Tweener]s use transitions and eases. The first accepts a [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [url=https://easings.net/]easings.net[/url] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum EaseType] constant, and controls where the [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum TransitionType] constants with [constant EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that looks best.
[url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/img/tween_cheatsheet.webp]Tween easing and transition types cheatsheet[/url]
[b]Note:[/b] Tweens are not designed to be re-used and trying to do so results in an undefined behavior. Create a new Tween for each animation and every time you replay an animation from start. Keep in mind that Tweens start immediately, so only create a Tween when you want to start animating.
[b]Note:[/b] The tween is processed after all of the nodes in the current frame, i.e. node's [method Node._process] method would be called before the tween (or [method Node._physics_process] depending on the value passed to [method set_process_mode]).

[b]Terminology:[/b] In the context of UPnP networking, "gateway" (or "internet gateway device", short IGD) refers to network devices that allow computers in the local network to access the internet ("wide area network", WAN). These gateways are often also called "routers".
[b]Pitfalls:[/b]
- As explained above, these calls are blocking and shouldn't be run on the main thread, especially as they can block for multiple seconds at a time. Use threading!
- Networking is physical and messy. Packets get lost in transit or get filtered, addresses, free ports and assigned mappings change, and devices may leave or join the network at any time. Be mindful of this, be diligent when checking and handling errors, and handle these gracefully if you can: add clear error UI, timeouts and re-try handling.
- Port mappings may change (and be removed) at any time, and the remote/external IP address of the gateway can change likewise. You should consider re-querying the external IP and try to update/refresh the port mapping periodically (for example, every 5 minutes and on networking failures).
- Not all devices support UPnP, and some users disable UPnP support. You need to handle this (e.g. documenting and requiring the user to manually forward ports, or adding alternative methods of NAT traversal, like a relay/mirror server, or NAT hole punching, STUN/TURN, etc.).
- Consider what happens on mapping conflicts. Maybe multiple users on the same network would like to play your game at the same time, or maybe another application uses the same port. Make the port configurable, and optimally choose a port automatically (re-trying with a different port on failure).
[b]Further reading:[/b] If you want to know more about UPnP (and the Internet Gateway Device (IGD) and Port Control Protocol (PCP) specifically), [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play]Wikipedia[/url] is a good first stop, the specification can be found at the [url=https://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications/upnp-resources/upnp/]Open Connectivity Foundation[/url] and Godot's implementation is based on the [url=https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp]MiniUPnP client[/url].

Before calling any of the [code]add_(un)do_*[/code] methods, you need to first call [method create_action]. Afterwards you need to call [method commit_action].
If you don't need to register a method, you can leave [method add_do_method] and [method add_undo_method] out; the same goes for properties. You can also register more than one method/property.
If you are making an [EditorPlugin] and want to integrate into the editor's undo history, use [EditorUndoRedoManager] instead.
If you are registering multiple properties/method which depend on one another, be aware that by default undo operation are called in the same order they have been added. Therefore instead of grouping do operation with their undo operations it is better to group do on one side and undo on the other as shown below.

[VoxelGI]s are used to provide high-quality real-time indirect light and reflections to scenes. They precompute the effect of objects that emit light and the effect of static geometry to simulate the behavior of complex light in real-time. [VoxelGI]s need to be baked before having a visible effect. However, once baked, dynamic objects will receive light from them. Furthermore, lights can be fully dynamic or baked.
[b]Note:[/b] [VoxelGI] is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.
[b]Procedural generation:[/b] [VoxelGI] can be baked in an exported project, which makes it suitable for procedurally generated or user-built levels as long as all the geometry is generated in advance. For games where geometry is generated at any time during gameplay, SDFGI is more suitable (see [member Environment.sdfgi_enabled]).
[b]Performance:[/b] [VoxelGI] is relatively demanding on the GPU and is not suited to low-end hardware such as integrated graphics (consider [LightmapGI] instead). To improve performance, adjust [member ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/voxel_gi/quality] and enable [member ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/gi/use_half_resolution] in the Project Settings. To provide a fallback for low-end hardware, consider adding an option to disable [VoxelGI] in your project's options menus. A [VoxelGI] node can be disabled by hiding it.
[b]Note:[/b] Meshes should have sufficiently thick walls to avoid light leaks (avoid one-sided walls). For interior levels, enclose your level geometry in a sufficiently large box and bridge the loops to close the mesh. To further prevent light leaks, you can also strategically place temporary [MeshInstance3D] nodes with their [member GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode] set to [constant GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_STATIC]. These temporary nodes can then be hidden after baking the [VoxelGI] node.

WebXR is an open standard that allows creating VR and AR applications that run in the web browser.

WebXR supports a wide range of devices, from the very capable (like Valve Index, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Quest) down to the much less capable (like Google Cardboard, Oculus Go, GearVR, or plain smartphones).

There are a couple ways to handle "controller" input:
- Using [XRController3D] nodes and their [signal XRController3D.button_pressed] and [signal XRController3D.button_released] signals. This is how controllers are typically handled in XR apps in Godot, however, this will only work with advanced VR controllers like the Oculus Touch or Index controllers, for example.
- Using the [signal select], [signal squeeze] and related signals. This method will work for both advanced VR controllers, and non-traditional input sources like a tap on the screen, a spoken voice command or a button press on the device itself.
You can use both methods to allow your game or app to support a wider or narrower set of devices and input methods, or to allow more advanced interactions with more advanced devices.

Provides a low-level interface for creating parsers for [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML]XML[/url] files. This class can serve as base to make custom XML parsers.
To parse XML, you must open a file with the [method open] method or a buffer with the [method open_buffer] method. Then, the [method read] method must be called to parse the next nodes. Most of the methods take into consideration the currently parsed node.
Here is an example of using [XMLParser] to parse a SVG file (which is based on XML), printing each element and its attributes as a dictionary:
[codeblocks]
[gdscript]
var parser = XMLParser.new()
parser.open("path/to/file.svg")
while parser.read() != ERR_FILE_EOF:

	if parser.get_node_type() == XMLParser.NODE_ELEMENT:
	    var node_name = parser.get_node_name()
	    var attributes_dict = {}
	    for idx in range(parser.get_attribute_count()):
	        attributes_dict[parser.get_attribute_name(idx)] = parser.get_attribute_value(idx)
	    print("The ", node_name, " element has the following attributes: ", attributes_dict)

[/gdscript]
[csharp]
var parser = new XmlParser();
parser.Open("path/to/file.svg");
while (parser.Read() != Error.FileEof)

	{
	    if (parser.GetNodeType() == XmlParser.NodeType.Element)
	    {
	        var nodeName = parser.GetNodeName();
	        var attributesDict = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary();
	        for (int idx = 0; idx < parser.GetAttributeCount(); idx++)
	        {
	            attributesDict[parser.GetAttributeName(idx)] = parser.GetAttributeValue(idx);
	        }
	        GD.Print($"The {nodeName} element has the following attributes: {attributesDict}");

The [XRAnchor3D] point is a spatial node that maps a real world location identified by the AR platform to a position within the game world. For example, as long as plane detection in ARKit is on, ARKit will identify and update the position of planes (tables, floors, etc) and create anchors for them.
This node is mapped to one of the anchors through its unique ID. When you receive a signal that a new anchor is available, you should add this node to your scene for that anchor. You can predefine nodes and set the ID; the nodes will simply remain on 0,0,0 until a plane is recognized.
Keep in mind that, as long as plane detection is enabled, the size, placing and orientation of an anchor will be updated as the detection logic learns more about the real world out there especially if only part of the surface is in view.

This is a helper spatial node for our camera; note that, if stereoscopic rendering is applicable (VR-HMD), most of the camera properties are ignored, as the HMD information overrides them. The only properties that can be trusted are the near and far planes.
The position and orientation of this node is automatically updated by the XR Server to represent the location of the HMD if such tracking is available and can thus be used by game logic. Note that, in contrast to the XR Controller, the render thread has access to the most up-to-date tracking data of the HMD and the location of the XRCamera3D can lag a few milliseconds behind what is used for rendering as a result.

This is a helper spatial node that is linked to the tracking of controllers. It also offers several handy passthroughs to the state of buttons and such on the controllers.
Controllers are linked by their ID. You can create controller nodes before the controllers are available. If your game always uses two controllers (one for each hand), you can predefine the controllers with ID 1 and 2; they will become active as soon as the controllers are identified. If you expect additional controllers to be used, you should react to the signals and add XRController3D nodes to your scene.
The position of the controller node is automatically updated by the [XRServer]. This makes this node ideal to add child nodes to visualize the controller.
As many XR runtimes now use a configurable action map all inputs are named.
